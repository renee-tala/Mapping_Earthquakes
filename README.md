# Mapping Earthquakes
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. The Challenge can be viewed in the "Earthquake Challenge" folder. 

- Resources: 
  - GeoJSON
  - Leaflet 
  - Javascript
  - D3.js library
  - Visual Studio Code 

## Summary 
Using the available resources, I created a map that shows Earthquake data in many forms:
- Base Layers:
  - Street
  - Satellite
  - Dark 
These base layers are in the top right toggle and can change the view of the map.

- Layers:
  - Earthquakes
  - Tectonic Plates
  - Major Earthquakes 
These layers can be used all at once, or one at a time. They change the data on the map.

- Radius:
  - Each circle's size is based on the radius of the earthquake
  - It's also color coded by magnitude
  - The legend for the color magnitude is in the bottom right of the map.
